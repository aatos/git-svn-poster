We present example use case for Git, a distributed version control
tool developed by Linus Torvalds and the Linux kernel team, together
with CERN central SVN version control for high energy physics data
analysis software maintenance.

Version control allows developers to keep track of project history in
a systematic and detailed manner. The project can be a data analysis
or simulation program source code, or even LaTeX code of a paper or
thesis. In addition to tracking history, version control tools allow
one to merge contributions between several authors.

CERN has chosen to upgrade their old cenralized CVS version control
system to another modernized centralized system called Subversion
(SVN). Unfortunately it does not offer the flexibility of the
distributed systems. Git can, however, be used as a ``super client''
with the CERN SVN service.

The most important advantage of distributed version control tools,
such as Git, over traditional centralized ones is that the distributed
tools don't need a central server. This allows users to utilize
version control easily and locally on their own computers without
heavy support infrastructure.
