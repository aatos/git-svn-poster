% intro

Version control allows software developers to keep track of project history in
a systematic and detailed manner. 
%The project can be a data analysis or simulation program source code, 
%or even LaTeX code of a paper or thesis. 
In addition to tracking history, version control tools allow
one to merge contributions between several authors.
% background
Recently CERN has chosen to upgrade centralised CVS version control
system \cite{cernsvn} to another modernised centralised system called Subversion (SVN) \cite{svnsite}.
Unfortunately it does not offer the flexibility of the
distributed systems we are interested in. 

%%% The following minipage structures are needed to position the figure
%%% beside the text paragraph.
%%% For a standard figure environment, see the example below.

\begin{minipage}{6cm}
% git details
Git, a distributed version control tool \cite{torvalds}, however, 
provides this flexibility, 
and can be used as a ``super client'' with the CERN SVN service.
We discuss advantages of distributed version control tools,
such as Git, over traditional centralised ones. 
Most significant advantage is that the distributed
tools don't need a central server, and users can utilise
version control locally on their own computers without
heavy support infrastructure.
% our case and example image
We present an example use case for Git in a HEP data analysis and publication writing project (Fig.~1)~\cite{pk09aProceedings}.
We also demonstrate how to use Git
together with CERN central SVN version control for high energy physics data
analysis software maintenance.
